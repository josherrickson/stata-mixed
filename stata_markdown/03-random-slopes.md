^#^ Random slopes

So far all we've talked about are random intercepts. This is by far the most common form of mixed effects regression models. Recall that we set up the
[theory](#mixed-model-theory.html#theory) by allowing each group to have its own intercept which we don't estimate. We can also allow each group to
have it's own slope which we don't estimate.
